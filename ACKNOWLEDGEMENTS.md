This is a likely very incomplete list of all the sources that helped in making `elara-gfx` possible:

- `glutin` and its developers, especially the [example](https://github.com/rust-windowing/glutin/blob/master/glutin_examples/src/lib.rs)
- GLFW + Rust examples by [@newvertex](https://gist.github.com/newvertex)
- The [Book of Shaders](https://thebookofshaders.com/) and its associated editor
- Examples from <https://open.gl/>
- Examples from <https://github.com/afaber999/rust_learn_opengl_glow/>
- [GLSL Sandbox](https://glslsandbox.com/)
- `Speedy2D` and its developers <https://github.com/QuantumBadger/Speedy2D>
- The very helpful tutorial series [OpenGL from scratch](http://nercury.github.io/rust/opengl/tutorial/2018/02/08/opengl-in-rust-from-scratch-00-setup.html)
- [Learn OpenGL Rust](https://rust-tutorials.github.io/learn-opengl/) which provided a lot of examples of OpenGL wrapping
